## The Hummel Lab of Clinical Neuroengineering
Our mission here the Hummel Lab is to develop novel personalized, neurotechnological interventions tailored to the individual to enhance functional recovery of sensorimotor and cognitive functions in patients suffering from neurological disorders. We aim to tackle conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or neurodegenerative disorders, by bringing neurotechnology from ‘bench to bedside’. We are multidisciplinary team of neuroscientiits, engineers, medical doctors, and psychologists working together to achieve these goals.
